    <p>Humanity is exploring space faster than ever before. Scientists are collecting vast amounts of data from distant planets. The question remains: does life exist beyond Earth?
        
        New telescopes are finding thousands of planets orbiting stars. The James Webb Space Telescope is helping identify habitable worlds. Gravitational wave detectors are also revealing distant cosmic events. These discoveries push us closer to understanding life’s possibilities.
        
        Commercial space companies are developing advanced spacecraft and reusable rockets. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission returned samples from asteroid Bennu. Multiple nations are sending robots to the moon and Mars. Human space travel to these celestial bodies is becoming more realistic.
        
        Defining life is more complex than it seems. Dictionaries describe it as the ability to grow and respond. Scientists, however, see life as a self-sustaining chemical system.

        Living organisms maintain order and require energy to function. Without energy, biological systems break down into disorder. DNA, RNA and proteins work together to sustain life. DNA holds instructions for growth and reproduction. Proteins perform essential tasks within cells.

        Life elsewhere may not follow Earth’s biological rules. Carbon-based life dominates our planet, but other elements could support life. Silicon, for example, has been considered a possible alternative. Some organisms on Earth already use silicon in their structures.</p>
